=== HIGH PRIORITY ===
add doors
add something animated
better file structure for everything pertaining to points and vectors (how I wish I could put everything in inline headers)

=== MEDIUM PRIORITY ===
move all view-related happenings into t_camera, away from t_player
implement tick throttle -- 24 FPS is more than enough, really
display a more descriptive error message if the player is not enclosed by walls

=== LOW PRIORITY ===
fix slow rendering when closely facing a wall ~ probably can't be done at all

=== MAYBE DO THIS TOO, BUT WE'LL PROBABLY BE FINE IF WE LEAVE IT BE ===
mark maps that have isolated empty space as invalid

=== THINGS THAT NEVER GO AWAY ===
Norminette!
