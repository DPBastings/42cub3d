=== HIGH PRIORITY ===
add doors
implement tick throttle (for animation!)
add something animated
better file structure for everything pertaining to points and vectors (how I wish I could put everything in inline headers)

=== MEDIUM PRIORITY ===
move all view-related happenings (delta_o, view_z) into t_camera, away from t_player
display a more descriptive error message if the player's start is not enclosed by walls

=== LOW PRIORITY ===
fix slow rendering when closely facing a wall ~ probably can't be done at all
have the minimap FOV be displayed as a cone

=== MAYBE DO THIS TOO, BUT WE'LL PROBABLY BE FINE IF WE LEAVE IT BE ===
mark maps that have isolated empty space as invalid
dithering
particle system
Shader ??

=== THINGS THAT NEVER GO AWAY ===
