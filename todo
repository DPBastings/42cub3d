general cleanup

fix double-width minimap walls at x = 0 || y = 0
fix slow rendering when closely facing a wall --> avoid using mlx_put_pixel_safe
sometimes one can get (seemingly) stuck in a corner, fix it

implement mouse view movement
implement dynamic zoom (mouse control via wheel)
add doors
make it so that diagonal movement against a wall is possible
make it so that the minimap rotates along with the player's view
implement fps throttle

cache the previous player position for quicker rendering?
make endianness-agnostic pixel placement and reading functions
